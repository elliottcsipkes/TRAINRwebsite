                        <p><strong>Mind Body Spirit Release™ (MBSR™)</strong> is designed to help remove cellular imprints from negative experiences and trauma. Our bodies
                        remember every hormone, neurotransmitter, energy/nerve block, limiting belief and emotion from each significant event in our lives. When our cells are triggered to recall an event, our bodies can re-enact the same experience on a biochemical level. This is done in the
                        subconscious over which we have no control.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="aboutcont">
                        <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/150/000000/biotech.png" class="icon"/>
                        <p>These biochemical reactions  can make us experience physical and emotional symptoms that we
                        would not like to have. For example, an imprinted limiting belief that you do not deserve to succeed will create a situation where you are
                        subconsciously sabotaging your ability to succeed (in career, relationships, health, weight…). No amount of positive thinking or
                        affirmation-saying can change this because 95% of the brain operates on a subconscious level and is making this decision for you.</p>

                        <p>MBSR™ is a way to help identify those negative cellular imprints buried in the subconscious and release them so that you are free to recreate your own story, to reach the goals you desire, to be more of the person you want to be. Depending on the number of layers or
                        imprints, results can be immediate, or can happen gradually through several clearings over time. Just know that a new and wonderful
                        freedom awaits you through MBSR™!</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <div class="howcont">
                <div class="intercont">
                    <p><strong>Accessing Blocks</strong><br> We use a technique sometimes applied by hypnotherapists, psychologists and psychotherapists called The Ideomotor Response. It is
                    easily done by measuring a muscle (-motor) response to an “idea” (ideo-) or statement. In this case, we use a pendulum which responds
                    via muscle movements in the hand. The subconscious mind provides data this way that is relevant to the blocks keeping you from
                    reaching your goals and then we are able to clear the subconscious blocks.</p>

            <div class="howcont">
                <div class="intercont">
                    <p><strong>Clearing Blocks</strong><br>we are aware of the blocks, we can use a cold laser to stimulate certain acupuncture points, meridians and reflex points to
                    eliminate the body’s stress reaction to the blocks and allow you to input healthy beliefs that support your goal.</p>
                    <img src="/images/AdobeStock_371529220.jpeg" alt="" class="howimage">

                <div class="intercont">
                    <p><strong>What To Expect After A Session</strong><br>MBSR™ is very individualized and each person processes through the clearing differently. Many people immediately feel like a weight
                    is lifted and are very relaxed and even a bit detached, while a small number go through a detox of sorts as the body is finally able to
                    release stored physical and emotional toxins. This is normal and healthy and very short-lived. Remember that this modality only truly
                    works if you are involved in the process, willing to let go of your blocks and willing to do the work to move to the next level of wellbeing.</p>
